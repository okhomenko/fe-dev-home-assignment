This assignment is designed to test your client-side coding skills and show us
what youâ€™re good at! You can add or modify any of the JavaScript, HTML and CSS
to complete the assignment. JQuery has been included for your convenience, but
is not required.

First, prioritize the list of tasks below from high to low (1 -> top priority,
7-> lowest priority). Please explain why you choose to prioritize this way,
and what you considered when assigning high or low priority to each task.

Second, pick one or two tasks out of the list and implement them. You may choose
whatever task you prefer that you think will best reflect your coding skills.

Tasks
========================================

I think two first task will show best my developer skills. I will try to work 
with them in Data-Driven way

1.  Split the reviews into blocks of 5 and create pagination. Allow the user
    to sort the reviews by review score.

I think this is the most valuable for user. As he already opened this hotel -
he/she would like to see reviews of other people

2.  Imagine there's a json feed with nearby landmarks. Design the json format
	and use it to display landmarks on the page.

This one also very valuable as user willing to find something in the area,
not only this specific hotel

3.  Improve the room table. Some ideas you may consider: allow the user to sort
    the rooms table by occupancy or price, display a total when the user selects
    a quantity, display additional information about rooms.

This one pretty valuable for users that already want to book room in this hotel

4.  Create a photo carousel using the large photos linked from the thumbnails
	currently in the page. Some ideas you may consider: include an automatic
	slideshow mode, add prev/next buttons to manually controll the carousel,
	add a layer that shows the contents of the images alt text.

Carousel is good UX but also if it is just list of images - also good.
Maybe simple lightbox could be good alternative.

5.  Imagine there's a json feed with hotels similar to the current one. Design
	the json format and use it to display similar hotels on the page.

Similar hotels would be better to combine with landmarks feature and show small preview on the map.

6.  Improve the facilities block.

Would be better to show icons of facilities. Order them by valuability for customers. and above the description

7.  Improve the hotel page however you see fit.
